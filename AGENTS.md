## Handoff & Shared State

Active task handoffs live in `docs/handoff/<slug>/`, each containing `CONTEXT.md`, `PLAN.md`, `PROGRESS.md`, and `DECISIONS.md`. `docs/handoff/INDEX.md` registers them.

`INDEX.md` is a markdown table, **one row per slug**, both human-readable and machine-parseable (`awk -F'|'` / `grep`): `| slug | status | depends-on | updated | note |`. `status` ∈ {`todo`, `in-progress`, `blocked`, `done`}; `depends-on` is a comma-separated list of slugs that must be `done` first (or `—`). `/plan` seeds the row, `/implement` advances its `status`, `/resume` reads it. Update the existing row — never append a duplicate.

**Archiving finished slugs.** A `done` slug stays useful as history but should stop competing with live work. `/archive <slug>` retires it by `git mv`-ing the package into `docs/handoff/_archive/<slug>/` and marking its INDEX row archived (status stays `done`; the `note` is prefixed `archived`). This is **manual and explicit — never automatic, never a delete**: the record is the point. The `_archive/` location is one level deeper than the "most recently touched" heuristic glob (`docs/handoff/*/PROGRESS.md`, used by `/resume`, `/implement`, and the Stop hook) reaches, so archived slugs drop out of it automatically without changing any glob. Only archive a slug whose INDEX status is `done` and whose PROGRESS agrees — finish or unblock live work first.

**One branch per slug, created as early as possible.** Each slug gets its own task branch, created at the *start* of the cycle (`/plan` branches from `main`/`master`) rather than at `/implement` time. This is a pre-requisite for parallel slugs: the optional Stop hook resolves the slug from the current branch, and `/dispatch` worktrees need a distinct branch per slug. Host-project prefixes are allowed (e.g. `feat/<slug>`) as long as the slug is derivable from the suffix. `/implement`'s branch step is an **idempotent safety net** — it creates the branch only if you're still on the default branch, and is a no-op once you're on the slug's branch.

**The "source plan" is any agreed plan draft, not a Claude-only artifact.** `/plan` materializes the handoff package — either authoring `PLAN.md` in place or ingesting an existing source plan — and `/clarify` then refines it. That source can be `~/.claude/plans/<slug>.md` (written by Claude Code's plan mode), a draft inside the repo (e.g. `docs/plans/<slug>.md`), or an explicit path passed to `/plan` as its second argument. The kit is tool-agnostic at the *entry point* too: a non-Claude planner can author the source plan anywhere and pass it to `/plan`, or hand-author the four files per this contract directly. Whichever path is used is recorded in the banner's provenance line (`source plan: <path>`, or `authored in place by /plan`), so the implementer can trace the spec back to its origin.

- **Before starting work on a task, read its handoff folder** (CONTEXT → PLAN → PROGRESS → DECISIONS). `PLAN.md` is the spec authored by the planning agent — implement against it and do not silently diverge.
- **Re-derive, don't just recall.** Open the files listed under CONTEXT's *Read first* and confirm they still match the spec before trusting its summary; the banner's provenance line (planner model + source plan path + commit SHA the spec was written against) tells you where the spec came from and how stale the map may be.
- **`PLAN.md` ends with a runnable `Verification` block** — the exact command(s) plus the observable pass signal. A step is "done" only when its verification command actually passes; report the real output, never assume.
- **Update `PROGRESS.md` after every meaningful change**: check off the steps you completed (`- [x]` / `🚧` / `⛔`) and append a work-log line `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM — <your agent name> — what changed`.
- **Record any deviation from `PLAN.md`, decision, or blocker in `DECISIONS.md`** before continuing, so the spec author can review it. Put questions that need the author's input under "Open questions for the spec author".
- **The back-channel is a loop, not a dead letter.** Open *Open questions for the spec author* are resolved by the planning agent only — the implementer must not guess past them or edit `PLAN.md`. `/resume` surfaces them as a decision queue for the planner to answer and fold back into the plan.
- **Keep the four files consistent with each other.** When reconciling, also check the package against itself: PROGRESS checkboxes must match PLAN steps, DECISIONS must not contradict PLAN, and the banner's provenance SHA flags how far the spec lags `HEAD`. Surface internal drift before resuming work on it.

The cycle is `/plan → /clarify → /resume → /implement → /code-review` (`/plan` writes the handoff package; `/handoff` was folded into it). Run `/handoff-init` once per project to (re)seed this section, `docs/handoff/INDEX.md`, and the optional hooks.
